## Description:

This project is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays creation of database using mySQL with models and associations. Then demonstrates the API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through videos.
Built using MySQL2, Express, Sequelize and dotenv.

## User Story:

`AS A manager at an internet retail company I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies`

## Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a functional Express.js API

- WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
  - THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
  - THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  - THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
  - THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  - THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
